# 🔗 AI-Powered URL Shortener (MERN + Groq API)

A full-stack web application to shorten long URLs into clean, shareable links — powered by **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB Atlas**, and **Groq AI API** for intelligent short-link suggestions.

---

## 🤖 What Makes This Special
Unlike a normal URL shortener, this project uses **Groq’s AI API** to generate **smart and memorable short link suggestions**.  
Instead of random strings like `abc123`, it can suggest human-friendly slugs like:
> `travel-deals`, `tech-news`, or `my-portfolio`

This feature showcases **AI integration in full-stack development** — blending backend logic with a modern AI API.
